SCENE 1: WHITOSITO, Part 1
Characters
Ferg, has a game to play
Ben, bad at the game
Presi, philosophical peacemaker
Customers in line

(On the apron, BEN, FERG, and PRESI all stand in line waiting. PRESI is behind FERG and BEN. FERG stands between BEN and PRESI. BEN impatiently twirls a car key on his finger.) 

BEN: Ugh. I’m so bored. I hate waiting. 

FERG: At least the line is moving fast.

BEN: What are we even waiting for?

FERG: Hmm… was it lunch? Breakfast? The bus? Who really knows? Hey, let’s play a game.

BEN: Alright. How do you play?

FERG: Ok, I say one word, then you say another word that makes sense to my word, then I say another connected word, and we try to make a sentence or a short story. For example, I say the word “one” then you could say “day,” then I could say “there,” and you could say “was,” and so on.

BEN: Sounds boring, but whatever. When do you know when to stop?

FERG: When it feels complete.

BEN: Okay, but how can you tell when it feels complete?

FERG: You just know, ok? It’s just a feeling that you get. You’ll know it when it comes.

BEN: Well, what if I don’t get feelings?

FERG: Are you kidding me? Everyone has feelings. It’s just part of being human. 

BEN: That’s not true, idiot.

FERG: Um. Yes it is, unless you happen to be a robot.

BEN: No, it isn’t.

(BEN and FERG’S voice gets louder every time.)

FERG: Yes, it is.

BEN: No, it isn’t.

FERG: Yes, it is.

BEN: No, it isn’t.

FREG: JUST SAY A WORD.

BEN: FINE. GIRL.

FREG: Sits.

BEN: In.

FREG: The.

BEN: Kitchen.

FERG: With.

BEN: Her.

FERG: Brother.

SCENE 2: A Trip to Flavortown
Characters
Josh Ovalle
Lily Ovalle
Guy Fieri
Rachael Ray
Ree Drummond
Fish the Fish

(RAIN STORM sound effect plays. CURTAINS open on JOSH and LILY sitting at the window watching the rain. A plate of hot dogs sits between them.)
 
JOSH: Lily?

LILY: Yes, Josh?

JOSH: I’m so bored.

LILY: Eat your hotdog.

JOSH: (sighing) Hot dogs are boring. There’s nothing to do.

LILY: Eat it now!

(JOSH taps his finger impatiently when he is interrupted by a ding-dong at the door.)

JOSH: Who could that be? Mom didn’t say anyone would be coming over.

LILY: Just go get the door.

JOSH: Why me? What if it’s a robber? Or a serial killer? Or (ominously) a solicitor?

LILY: Better you than me. Besides, you’re closer.

JOSH: Fine.

(JOSH walks over and answers the door. GUY FIERI stands in the doorway and points at JOSH.)

GUY FIERI: Hi, Josh. Welcome to Flavortown!

JOSH: Wow! Wait… 

GUY FIERI: What?

JOSH: Are you Guy Fieri? You’re my idol! Lily, look who’s here!

LILY: Woah! This is weird and awesome. Why are you here?

GUY FIERI: I was on my way to review a pizzeria nearby for my next episode of Triple D, but I heard you kids were bored and eating really bad hot dogs so I rushed right over to help you have some fun! I know just what to do. Here, put these on.  

(GUY FIERI hands extra fiery glasses to JOSH and LILY. They put them on.)

JOSH: Wow! There are flames on everything!

GUY FIERI: Look up.

(JOSH and LILY look up.)

JOSH: Woah!

LILY: Everything has frosted tips!

GUY FIERI: Yes, how beautiful it is. Now let’s have a some fun.

(GUY FIERI enters house.)

FISH THE FISH: Don’t let him in. He’ll make a mess! Your parents will be furious!

GUY FIERI: I call my first game, Fry the Fish. It’s simple. All you need is a frying pan and your fish!

FISH THE FISH: Uh oh.

(GUY FIERI puts hands on fish bowl.)

LILY: I don’t think that’s…

FISH THE FISH: (upset) What are you doing?! Take your hand of my bowl! You have no right to be here! Go take a stroll!

GUY FIERI: Ok, how do you fry a fish?

FISH THE FISH: WOAH! Your taking this too far! I will refuse to be cooked! Go get in your car!

JOSH: I don’t know. You’re the chef!

GUY FIERI: (laughs) Actually, I can’t cook! When this all started, I thought it was a joke. My wife, Lori, doesn’t even let me cook in the house. Luckily, I was born for the Food Network. You know I’ve got a face for TV. Did you know my blood is 70% caramel and I know the name of every breakfast sandwich from New Jersey as well as every cut of meat from a squid.

LILY: And you’re so shiny!

JOSH: So, what can you do?

GUY FIERI: I'm a culinary gangsta with a very spiritual side. I just drive around and watch other people cook, taste stuff, say things like “the bomb’ and “off the hook”. I make everything look like fun! Speaking of fun, how about that fry the fish game?

LILY:  Maybe we shouldn’t fry our fish? 
 
(JOSH takes GUY’S hands off fish bowl.)

GUY FIERI: Oh, all right, I have another game we can play. I’ll be right back!

(GUY runs out of the house and then returns with two boxes.)

FISH THE FISH: You have to leave now. You will get us in trouble! Out, Out, Guy Fieri! Out on the double!

GUY FIERI: Inside of my boxes I have two things: Thing One and Thing Two. Also known as Rachel Ray and Ree Drummond. When I open the latch, you will see them come out. 

FISH THE FISH: No, Guy Fieri! Mom will get mad! You are just so very bad bad bad!

GUY FIERI: Oh, they won’t hurt you, fish. They’re so well behaved! Besides, these ladies can really cook. Say hello!

(GUY opens the latch. RACHEL RAY and REE DRUMMOND appear.)

REE AND RACHEL:  Hi!

FISH THE FISH: Oh, I really don’t think so Guy and Ree and Rachael Ray. I will start to scream if you don’t go away.

RACHAEL RAY and REE DRUMMOND: Hi, it’s nice to meet you!

LILY: Oh, it’s nice to meet you both too?

REE DRUMMOND: So, what do you kids wanna eat?

JOSH: Anything but hot dogs.

Rachael Ray: How about my meatball sub?

JOSH: Uh… 

REE DRUMMOND: Oh, and my Rootin’ Tootin’ Baked Cowboy Beans! All ya’ll are gonna love ‘em!

LILY:  I don’t like beans that much….

GUY FIERI: The kitchen is over here.

FISH THE FISH: Stop! Stay away from that kitchen with your weird cooking fads! If they make a mess, your mom will be mad! 

(All approach stove, and start tearing it apart.)

GUY FIERI: Relax, fish. 

(GUY covers the fish bowl with a blanket.)

RACHAEL RAY: Step one: place ground sirloin in a large mixing bowl and punch a well into the center of meat. Fill well with the egg, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, Worcestershire, parsley, cheese, car tires, gasoline, rubber chickens, baby doll, books, bag of flour, milk, ice blocks, Elmers glue, bricks, pack of pencils, and a little salt and pepper.

GUY FIERI: Sounds delicious, Rachel. Except for the eggs. Hey, did you know I made up the name Cinnamon Toast Crunch? General Mills was going to call it “Cinnamon Cereal”, but I was like, guys, I’ve got something better.

REE DRUMMOND: That’s real fascinatin, but back to me. For my first step: in a heavy pot, saute the bacon pieces with a pinch of cat litter until halfway cooked and the fat is rendered. Add the green peppers, onions, garlic, and dental floss to the pot and cook until startin’ to get brown. Or blue. About 3 minutes.

GUY FIERI: You know what I’ve been thinking? It’s unfair to call Russian dressing Russian dressing — it should be called something sexy, like Liquid Moscow.

(Food is everywhere. FISH shakes off blanket.)

FISH THE FISH: OKAY, THAT’S IT! No more Guy, no more mess! Clean up and get out, you are NOT welcomed guests! In fact, you’re becoming one big frosted-tipped pest!

(RACHAEL and REE exit looking very sad.)

GUY FIERI: OK fish. I’ll get going, but there is just one more thing I have to do!

(GUY runs outside then returns in a red convertible. It picks up all the food, while he drives around the kitchen, yelling “Yaowwwww.”)

GUY FIERI: Yao! Look at me clean! Like I was never here! And before I leave, remember: if it tastes really good, and it's funky, it's funkalicious. You’ve just taken a trip to Flavortown! Yaowwwww!!!

(CURTAINS close.)



SCENE 3: WHITOSITO, Part 2
(On apron, LIGHTS fade in on FERG and BEN as they resume arguing.)

FERG: I think it feels done.

BEN: No, it doesn’t.

FERG: Yes, it does.

BEN: No, it doesn’t.

PRESI:(to FERG and BEN) Hey man… I’m sensing some serious tension here. No need to fight, brothers. There’s always room for more peace.

FERG: Fine, if you don’t have feelings and you can’t tell us when the story is complete, then I’ll tell us when. Ok?

BEN: Got it.

FERG: Good. you start.

BEN: Seven.

FERG: Old.

BEN: People.

FERG: Sit.

BEN: In.

FERG: A.

BEN: Cafeteria.

(LIGHTS out.)


SCENE 4: Lunch Room Drama
Characters
Jasper, with IV bag and heart monitor
Jimmy, talks like a teenager trying to be cool
Debbie, bossy
Emma
Donald, with a walker
Pippa, snobby
Johnny the Orderly

(Cue Elevator Music. CURTAINS open to DEBBIE sitting at a table with old board games and a deck of cards. DEBBIE is knitting a red hat. JASPER and JIMMY enter.)

DEBBIE: What took you so long? I saved you seats.

JASPER: I got here as fast as I could because it’s Meatloaf Monday!

DEBBIE: No, you ol’ coot. It’s Taco Tuesday.

JASPER: Oh my days! You clearly can’t remember your days anymore, ya blue-haired biddy!

DEBBIE: Well, I never!

JIMMY: You guys are both wrong! It’s Saturday so we’re having Sloppy Joes!

DEBBIE and JASPER: It’s not Saturday! 

PIPPA: I despise Sloppy Joes. They’re soooo (pause) sloppy.

JIMMY: Then what are we having, smarty pants?

DEBBIE: Tacos!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

(EMMA enters.)

EMMA: What is all the commotion about?

JIMMY: I’m trying to tell these old geezers what day it is. They just can't figure it out! 

EMMA: Oh that's an easy one. It’s Funyun Friday.

(DONALD enters.)

DONALD: Did someone say Funyuns? I love Funyuns! Too bad though, it’s Weiner Wednesday.

EVERYONE: It’s not Wednesday!

DEBBIE: We’re not having weiners. No weiners!  

JASPER: Okay everybody, settle down or someone's gonna pass out. 

DONALD: My hemorrhoids!

(DONALD passes out. EMMA starts to fan him.)

JASPER: Let’s just all agree on one thing. 

DEBBIE: And what’s that?

JASPER: We’re having meatloaf today! Wahoo!

DEBBIE: Come on, Jasper, get with the program! We had meatloaf yesterday! So if I am right, which I always am, we should be having tacos today.

PIPPA: Well, thank goodness it’s Thursday because tacos are so spicy. 

(DONALD wakes up.)

DONALD: What? What did I miss?

EMMA: Ah, not much dear. We’re just waiting for lunch to be served.

PIPPA: Yes, and it’s Thursday! The day we indulge in escargot and caviars from Paris and Rome, and a string quartet serenades us. Oh, and happy hour! How happy we all will be! 

DONALD: Pippa, when has that ever happened here?

PIPPA: Oh, I don’t remember, but Thursday really is the best day. I’m sure of it.

DONALD: You’re all wrong! Wiener Wednesday is the best day… and, guess what, today is Wednesday!

(PIPPA scrunches her nose in disgust.)

PIPPA: Only a fool would find Wiener Wednesday the best.

DONALD: Oh yeah? Well, I don’t think eating dried up salty snails is the most appetizing dish either. Back in my day, snails belonged on the ground… And now that I think about it, we used kill ‘em with a salt shaker. 

PIPPA: Blasphemy! Escargot is an art form. 

DONALD: I don’t give a flying flub dub.

EMMA: What was that, dear? Scrubba Lubba dub dub??

JASPER: Can you all just stop arguing for one second?! Cause we all know we are having MEATLOAF!

DEBBIE: TACOS!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

JIMMY: SLOPPY JOES!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

DONALD: WIENER WRAPS!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

PIPPA: ESCARGOT!

DONALD: I just WANNA TAKE A NAP!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

EMMA: I WANT PIEEEEE!!!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

PIPPA: Paella!

JASPER: Meatloaf!

DEBBIE: Pizza!

JASPER: My sciatica!

DONALD: I’m tired of waiting.  I have a mind to get my walker and zip down the street for a sandwich!

EMMA: You can’t leave!

(JOHNNY THE ORDERLY enters.) 

JOHNNY THE ORDERLY: Hey, hey, hey, what's going on in here?

DONALD: We’re hungry! What’s for lunch today, sonny?

JOHNNY THE ORDERLY: Oh, that's an easy one. It’s Survivor Sunday. We’re just going to feed you all of the leftover food from every day last week. So you can pick whichever meal you want.

JASPER: YESSSS! I get to eat my meatloaf!!

JOHNNY THE ORDER: Actually, we don’t have any meatloaf.

(JASPER falls to floor.)

JASPER: Nooooo!!!

JOHNNY THE ORDERLY: But we have everything else.

PIPPA: Oh joy! I get to eat my juicy escargot.

JOHNNY THE ORDERLY: Yep, that's right! 

PIPPA: You are a true lifesaver, Johnny.

(JOHNNY THE ORDERLY looks at them confused, shrugs, and exits. Then, they are all distracted by a butterfly.)

DEBBIE: Wow, look at the butterfly, you guys. What a beauty.

EVERYONE: WOWWWWW… 

(Pause.)

JASPER: Wait--what were we talking about again?

(Everyone shrugs and goes back to what they were doing before. Cue elevator music. CURTAINS close.)

SCENE 5: WHITOSITO, Part 3
(LIGHTS up on FERG, BEN, PRESI, and CUSTOMERS IN LINE.)

BEN: Then.

FREG: They.
 
BEN: Went.

FREG: To.

BEN: Sleep.

FERG: Ugh. No Ben! You have to make it so I can keep going. You can’t just make the story end like that.

BEN: Well, why not? Sometimes, that's just all there is to life. People go home and sleep. The End.

FERG: Yes, you’re right Ben, sometimes life’s just boring and simple like that, but the point of this game is to be creative and make the story go as long as possible, so we’re not bored while we wait. 

BEN: Alright, fine. Let’s try again.

FERG: Once.

BEN: Upon.

FERG: A.

BEN: Time. 

FERG: The.

BEN: Big.

FERG: Fat.

BEN: Ugly.

FERG: Cookie Monster.

BEN: Hey! Why did you say the Cookie Monster? The Cookie Monster is a big blue beautiful thing. He’s not ugly or fat. Sure, he may have a little chub chub in the tub tub, but you still shouldn’t have used the Cookie Monster’s name for that. Not cool, dude. That was very rude and disrespectful!

FERG: Geez. Sorry, I didn’t realize that you had strong feelings for the Cookie Monster. I mean, after all… it's just a big blue puppet that eats cookies all day.

BEN: Well obviously, you don't know me well enough then.

FERG: Yeah, I obviously don’t.

BEN: Hmph. 

FERG: Hmph. 

(They turn away from each other, arms crossed and grumpy. Pause before FERG notices PRESI.)

FERG: (to PRESI) Hey there.

PRESI: Sup.

FERG: Wanna play a game?

PRESI: Sure, what game?

FERG: Ok. So I say a few words, then you say a few more that connect to my last few words to make a storyline or something poetic. 

PRESI: Sounds interesting, like it could really expand our minds and really draw out our creative spirits. 

FERG: Um, I guess.

PRESI: Do we start with a base theme? Or just something random?

FERG: We can start with a theme, I guess.  

PRESI: What should it be?

FERG: What about we start with chefs in a pizza parlor? 

(LIGHTS out.)

SCENE 6: Gustav’s Pizza
Characters
All wear aprons, chef hats, and have moustaches.
Sven, loves dough
Augustus, covered in spaghetti
Gustav, loves toppings, his chef hat is red since he’s the boss
Hugo, loves cheese, bald with big moustache
French Cat Burglar a.k.a. Damian the Crawler

(Italian music plays as CURTAINS open on Gustav’s Pizzeria. SVEN, AUGUSTUS, GUSTAV, and HUGO prance onto the stage and gather around the counter. Pizza oven(s) can be seen in the background.)

GUSTAV: Sven, Augustus, Hugo, my brothers! Are you ready to feed the pizza pies to our lovely hungry customers? 

SVEN: Yes, we will fill them up with our wonderful food! Augustus, go get the pizzas from the ovens.

(AUGUSTUS opens the ovens.)

AUGUSTUS: AH! Our pizzas! What happened to our beautiful pizzas?

GUSTAV: Whatever do you mean, Augustus? Aren’t the pizzas in the ovens? I left them there. No?

AUGUSTUS: (shaking his head, worried) No, no pizza here, Gustav. I’m sure of it.

(FRENCH CAT BURGLAR runs across the stage carrying the pizzas.)

FRENCH CAT BURGLAR: (in French accent) Ahah! Now I will have all the pizzas for myself! Hon hon hon!

(FRENCH CAT BURGLAR runs off of the stage--and perhaps through the audience carrying a tall stack of pizza boxes.)

HUGO: Now how will we serve our hungry customers? They are tired of waiting and we have no pizzas!

AUGUSTUS: What if we tried to make other foods? I know how to make some very good spaghet.

(SVEN smacks AUGUSTUS on the back of the head with a wooden spoon.)

SVEN: You meatball! Our customers want the pizza right now! Listen to them!

HUNGRY MOB: (from off stage) Pizza Pie! Pizza Pie! Pizza Pie!

SVEN: It’s a riot out there! Our restaurant is ruined!

GUSTAV: Whoa, calm down there, Sven. It looks like we’ll have to make the pizzas from scratch.

HUGO: (whispering) But we don’t know how to make the pizzas. We always order them from Dominos and then let them sit in the ovens so they stay warm. No! I can’t make the pizza pie!

AUGUSTUS: Hush, Hugo! Someone might hear.

(AUGUSTUS pauses to make sure no one heard.)

AUGUSTUS: Anyway, you’re brain is dumb, Hugo. Pizzas are easy to make. Do we have the dough?

SVEN: Ahhhh yes, the dough! Truly the finest and most underrated part of the pizza. No pizza would be a pizza without the dough. A great pizza dough is gluttonously delicious and makes the taste buds dance like wombats in a meat fryer. (takes deep breath) Truly, a work of the gods.  It rises through our mouths and into our brains and elevates us above our own dimensional plane of existence. 

AUGUSTUS: (rolling eyes) Yes, Sven, we all know you like the dough. But the sauce is best? No?

SVEN: Meh.

AUGUSTUS: And the cheese?

HUGO: Ah yes, the cheese! The cheese is the most delectable part of the entira pizza, so creamy and soft, like a river of molten lava that won’t kill you but in fact, makes you stronger. And our mozzarella squeezed from the teet of the water buffalo in the hills of Mother Italia. Simply the best.

AUGUSTUS: And what about the toppings?

GUSTAV: Toppings, aah, toppings are the personality of the pizza. And what is a pizza pie without personality? It is a like a nap without a pillow, a bird without a song, a fish out of the water! It’s nothing! (spits on floor)

AUGUSTUS: (in sarcastic voice) Yes yes, Gustav, toppings are magnificent.

HUGO: Ahah! It looks like the pizza pie will be made after all! We cannot be a stopped!

(LIGHTS dim and the table in the middle of the room is illuminated with light as “That’s Amore” starts to play. All the chefs sway. Enter CHORUS. During the song, SVEN pulls out a ball of dough from his apron pocket and throws it up in the air and then makes it into a pizza shape and places it onto the table; AUGUSTUS throws some sauce into a pan and then throws the sauce onto the dough; SVEN sprinkles some seasoning onto the crust of the dough; HUGO tosses some grated cheese from his apron pocket onto the pizza; SVEN throws some pepperoni slices from his pocket onto the pizza and throws some sand towards the audience; and finally, GUSTAV puts the finished pizza onto the table.)







That’s Amore Parody

When the dough hits the air 
Like the cheese in your hair
That's amore

When the sauce hits the pan 
Like the Great Pizza Man
That's amore

Add seasoning 
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling 
And you’ll sing “Vita Bella”

Have a good day 
Tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay 
With the fresh mozzarella

When the cheese hits the sauce 
Like it’s made by Rick Ross
That's amore

When the meat hits the pie 
Like the sand in your eye 
You’re in love

When you eat in a dream 
But you know you’re not dreaming, signore
Scuzza me
But you see
At Gustav’s Pizzaria 
That’s amore!

(LIGHTS up.)

AUGUSTUS: Now our customers can finally have a nice meal of pizza!

SVEN: It is perfection! But this one pizza is nowhere near enough to feed our hungry customers! We will have to get the pizzas back from that despicable French Cat Burglar. But how?

(CHEFS pause to think.)

HUGO: Ahah! I have the perfect plan!

(CHEFS lean in toward HUGO.)

GUSTAV: What is it, Hugo?

HUGO: Let me tell you. First, we leave the pizza sitting here, and wait for that dastardly villain, the French Cat Burglar, to come back and snatch it. But we will be one step ahead of him, ahah! We will already be hiding in the ovens, waiting for him to come back. And then, when the time is right, we roll out from inside the ovens and intimidate him with our good looks and charm.

SVEN: What a wonderful idea, Hugo! 

(LIGHTS dim as the CHEFS all hide in the ovens and wait for FRENCH CAT BURGLAR to come back and steal their pizza. After they are all inside the ovens, there is a pause.)

HUGO: I wonder what Momma and Papa are up to these days… 

GUSTAV: They’d be so proud. Shhh, I think I hear him coming!

(FRENCH CAT BURGLAR creeps in on tiptoes, carrying the stack of pizzas.)

FRENCH CAT BURGLAR: Hon hon hon! I cannot wait to eat these delicious pizzas, but I need more for my gang. Ahah! Sniff* Sniff* What is zat I smell? Another pizza perhaps? Yes, I see it, all the way on the other side of the room. It is (blows a kiss) perfection. I must have it. Now all I have to do to is creep to the table, and snatch it away. Hon hon hon!

(FRENCH CAT BURGLAR creeps towards the table with an evil grin, but before he can snatch the pizza away, the CHEFS all roll out from inside the ovens in T-poses.)

FRENCH CAT BURGLAR: Aaahh!

GUSTAV: What lovely smile you have there.

HUGO: You are one cool bean.

SVEN: How is the weather down there?

AUGUSTUS: I luv your moustache.

FRENCH CAT BURGLAR: Oof ow! My absolute head! I’ve been deceived!

AUGUSTUS: Quick, tie him up!

(FRENCH CAT BURGLAR tries to get away, but GUSTAV is too fast. GUSTAV ties the FRENCH CAT BURGLAR up with a spaghetti noodle from his apron pocket.)

GUSTAV: Now it is time to see who you really are, French Cat Burglar!

(GUSTAV rips off FRENCH CAT BURGLAR’S mask revealing his true identity: DAMIAN THE CRAWLER.) 

ALL: *Gasp!

GUSTAV: Damian the Crawler!

DAMIAN THE CRAWLER: (without French accent) Well well well, you’ve finally found out my true identity. I would say congratulations Gustav, but you are a big dumb! When you first defeated me in that Kung Fu tournament all those years ago, you ruined my life! I turned to a life of crime, constantly stealing away food and whatever else I could find so that me and my gang could survive. But no more! I challenge you, Gustav, to one last fight!

GUSTAV: Ah, I see your double digit IQ is rearing its ugly head again, Damian, but I accept your challenge.

(“Kung Fu Fighting” plays as GUSTAV and DAMIAN THE CRAWLER fight using kicks, punches, and items throughout the kitchen. It is obvious that GUSTAV is winning the fight.)

DAMIAN THE CRAWLER: Arrrghhh! Enough! It’s time to end this!

(DAMIAN THE CRAWLER changes into his final form: he pulls on a leather jacket, greases back his hair, and starts crawling on all fours, spitting green acid.)

DAMIAN THE CRAWLER: Take this, you uncultured swine!

(DAMIAN THE CRAWLER charges towards GUSTAV. GUSTAV dodges out of the way and DAMIAN crashes into a wall.)

GUSTAV: (chuckling) I see your skills haven't improved at all since we last fought, Damian. Wareware wa ikutsu ka no waiyā o kattoshite ikutsu ka no henkō o kuwaeru tsumoridesu!

(RED LIGHT follows DAMIAN THE CRAWLER as he exits in disgrace.)

DAMIAN THE CRAWLER: (diminuendo) Noooooooooooooooooo!

(CHEFS regroup.)

GUSTAV: Well, it looks like our work here is done, boys.

(GUSTAV picks up the stack of pizzas.)

SVEN: Now let’s go serve our hungry customers!

HUNGRY MOB: (from off stage) Pizza Pie! Pizza Pie! Pizza Pie!

(ALL exit carrying their pizzas. CURTAINS close.)

SCENE 7: WHITOSITO, part 4
(LIGHTS up on FERG, BEN, PRESI, and CUSTOMERS IN LINE.)

FERG: Hey, that wasn’t that bad. The song is stuck in my head, though. (Hums “That’s Amore.”)

PRESI: Yeah man, but that story didn’t feel very me. And you have the worst Italian accent. Let’s go again? I’ll start this time. The theme is a kid on a bar.

FERG: Okay. Kid on a bar.

(LIGHTS dim. RED LIGHT up. Intense music plays.)

PRESI:(intensely) Bar breaks.

(LIGHTS up. RED LIGHT out. Music stops.) 

FERG: Are you already killing the character in your first line?

PRESI: Yup.

FERG: You can’t do that.

PRESI: Yes you can. It happens in life all the time.

FERG: But if you already kill the character then how can you make the story continue? 

PRESI: You’ll see. Just keep adding to it. Let it flow, man.

FERG: Ok, let’s start over.

(LIGHTS dim. RED LIGHT up. Intense music plays.)

PRESI: Upside down on a bar.

FERG: Hands slip.

PRESI: Falls on head.

FERG: Neck breaks.

PRESI: Blood rushes out.

(LIGHTS up. RED LIGHT out. Music stops.)

FERG: Geez Presi, you really don’t have to make everything that sad and gory.

PRESI: Yes, I do. Suffering is part of life. You can’t deny it. You have to embrace it. Just keep going, it doesn’t matter.

FERG: Fine. Body Limp. 

(LIGHTS dim. RED LIGHT up. Intense music plays.)

PRESI: Family sad.

FERG: Body burned.

PRESI: Blankness.

FERG: Existence forgotten.

PRESI: Black hole in memories.

FERG: Black hole sucks everything in.

PRESI: Universe consumed.

FERG: Just a blank void.

PRESI: Nothing.

FERG: Darkness all around.

PRESI: Sound consumed.

FERG: A dot of light!

PRESI: Little organism.

FERG: Black hole vomits.

PRESI: Universe exists!

FERG: Life once again!

PRESI: Boy back on the bar.

FERG: Grip slips.

PRESI: Neck breaks.

FERG: Everything repeats.

PRESI: The End.

(LIGHTS up. RED LIGHT out. Music stops.)

FERG: Wow, that was good. A lot better than Ben’s.

BEN: Um excuse me, but I--

FERG: You’re just bad at making stories.

BEN: That's not true.

FERG: Um, it is too.

BEN: Is not!

FERG: Is too!

BEN: Is not!

FERG: Is too!

PRESI: Does it really even matter, guys? 

FERG and BEN: Yes!

PRESI: Look, a story is a story whether it’s good or bad or Ben’s. 

FERG: Whatever. I’m hungry. And I’m done with you both. Let’s just stand here and say nothing for the rest of the time.

BEN and PRESI: Fine.

BEN: (to Presi) You want to play a round?

PRESI: Sure.

BEN: Girls.

PRESI: At.

BEN: A.

PRESI: Slumber. 

BEN: Party.

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
GIANT GRASSES
GIANT LADYBUGS

(CURTAINS open on a backyard slumber party. A lantern hangs from a tree limb. LIGHTS are dim and blueish. Backpacks and sleeping bags cover the stage. LILA, ABBY, and ALLY sit on their sleeping bags. AUTUMN stands in the middle of the sleeping bags being bossy. CHRISSA is off stage. Plays GJWHF, fades to background)

AUTUMN: Okay, Lila… uh, move your sleeping bag over a little… ‘okay, that’s good. Ally no! Ugh. You can move your smelly feet in that direction! 

ALLY: My feet do not stink! 

LILA: What is taking that pizza so long? It’s taking forever. 

(Enter GUSTAV.) 

GUSTAV: Pizza delivery!

AUTUMN: We’re over here!

ALLY: OMG, look at his mustache.

LILA: Gross, but he’s kind of cute.

ABBY: How old do you think he is?

ALLY: Let’s ask him… 

(Girls giggle.)

GUSTAV: They don’t pay me enough for this.

(GUSTAV exits. THEY eat pizza.) 

ABBY: Mmmm… This pizza is so good!

AUTUMN: I was literally starving.

ALLY: The cheese is so cheesy.

ABBY: (louder than before) This pizza is so good!

LILA: What kind of mushrooms are these?

AUTUMN: I don’t know. I just picked the first pizza on the menu. 

ABBY: (even louder) This pizza is so good!
 
AUTUMN: We all heard you the first time! Okay, girls, so what’s up with Hannah G.?

LILA: Uh, trust me, she’s such a goodie-goodie. She’s got nothing.

ABBY: Oh, come on. We all know she has a deep dark secret.

ALLY: What is it? Oh my god, tell me.

AUTUMN: Are we talking about the same Hannah G? ‘Cuz I’m talking about the one with two ‘N’s and the ‘H’. Not the one with one ‘N’ and no ‘H.’

ALLY: I don’t know how she spells her name, but I heard she got an F in art and her parents smashed her phone right in front of her.

ABBY: I heard she smashed her own phone and used the pieces in a collage.

LILA: Yeah, the art teacher was so impressed she got an A.

AUTUMN: I don’t know. Whatever. You guys clearly don’t know what’s going on.

(Pause to eat more pizza.)

ABBY: This pizza is so good!  

AUTUMN: Yeah Abby, we got the message! But honestly,  I’m stuffed. 

ALLY: Me too.

AUTUMN: What should we do now? I know, let’s turn off the lights and play truth or dare. 

ALL BUT AUTUMN: Ooooh yeah!

ALLY: Shouldn’t we at least wait until Chrissa comes back from the bathroom before we turn out the lights? 

AUTUMN: Oh yeah… Chrissa… 

ALLY: How is it that you’re always forgetting about her?

AUTUMN: I am not! Pass me the last piece. And stop being so extra!

ALLY: Since when am I the extra one?  

(Enter CHRISSA, carrying a little bag with a hairbrush sticking out of it. ABBY takes another selfie.)

CHRISSA: Hey guys… 

ALL BUT AUTUMN: Hey Chrissa.

AUTUMN: Oh hey. Sorry, you missed the pizza.

CHRISSA: What? Wait--you guys ate all the pizza without me?!

ALL: Uhhh… 

ALLY: Here, you can have the rest of my piece.

CHRISSA: Thanks, Ally.

(LILA pulls out lipstick and a hand mirror and re-applies a layer.)

AUTUMN: Now can I turn out the light?

ALLY: Okay. But grab the chips while you’re at it. 

(LIGHTS off. Flashlights on. AUTUMN presents the bag of chips.)

ABBY: What kind of chips are those? 

AUTUMN: Salt and vinegar.

ABBY: (looking up from phone) Can I have some? 

AUTUMN: Fine.

(AUTUMN hands bag of chips to ABBY. ABBY opens chip bag upside down.)

AUTUMN: Why did you open them upside down?

ABBY: What do you mean? 

AUTUMN: Nevermind.

(ABBY taps on her phone and gasps.)

ABBY: OMG, you guys! It’s 9:99 pm! Group selfie time!

LILA: (annoyed) 9:99 isn’t even a time.

AUTUMN: Someone’s cranky…

LILA: 9.99 is a sale price, NOT a time.

ABBY: Fine, Just scrunch in and smile. (All girls pose, ABBY examines the photo) Wow, that’s a great picture, of me. I’m gonna post it.

AUTUMN: (yawning) I know we said we were gonna play a game, but all of a sudden, I can’t keep my eyes open.

ABBY: (yawning) I’m really sleepy too… 

CHRISSA: (yawning) Soooo sleepy… 

LILA: You babies! I thought we were gonna stay up all night. I’m not sleepy at all--(yawns) Let’s just play…  

(LILA passes out and immediately starts snoring.) 

ALLY: Oh come on, let’s just play one or two rounds of truth or dare.

ABBY: Fine. Truth or dare?

ALL: Truth.

ABBY: How many people have you kissed?

ALLY: (giddy) One…

CHRISSA: (sad) None… 

AUTUMN: (counting on fingers) Six, Seven…?

(More yawns, then snoring, lots of snoring… They all passed out. CURTAIN closes. Peaceful night noises: crickets, wind howling, owl hooting… wolf howls… Then stomp, stomp, stomp! Sinister night noises: crickets turn to cicadas, wind howls louder with lightning, owls begin to screech… 

(CURTAINS open. GIANT GRASSES sway. CHRISSA startles, and wakes.)

CHRISSA: What was that? I gotta pee.

(CHRISSA stands up, stares, confused at the giant leaves. GIANT LADYBUGS enter.)

CHRISSA: AAAHHHHH!!!!

(GIRLS wake up.)

AUTUMN: Oh my gosh, what’s wrong? Oh my god, what’s that thing?

ABBY: Why is it so big?

LILA: What was in that pizza?!
 
ALLY: Maybe it’s the apocalypse!

ABBY: Or the earthquake!

AUTUMN: We should hide.

(GIRLS hide under a blanket. Cue song, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun.” They emerge from the blanket. Dancing, singing, fun goes full tilt.) 






Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Parody

I woke up in the middle of the night
Those giant ladybugs really gave me a fright
An apocalypse? God, now I’m done!
And girls just wanna fun!
Oh girls, just wanna have fun!

Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have--

Belly hurts, in the middle of the night 
Those mushrooms on that pizza didn’t do me right
Oh, Gustav’s, you know you’re still number #1
But now, I’m cramping up
And girls just wanna have fun

That’s all they really want
Some fun
When the day of school is done, oh girls
They wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have--
	
Some girls, they get so scared
Come on girls, let down your hair!
We’ll play till we see the sun
Girls just wanna have fun 
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have fun
Girls…
Wanna have--

They just wanna, they just wanna 
They just wanna, they just wanna
Girls… Girls just wanna have fun!!

(GIRLS go back under the blanket as song ends.)

CHRISSA: Hey, are you guys awake?

ABBY: I’m awake. I think.

LILA: I’m awake.

AUTUMN: Me too.

ALLY: What just happened?

CHRISSA: Ummmm… A weird dream, I guess. A REALLY weird dream. 

ABBY: I had a weird dream too. I was at some party… a grass party. 

LILA: There were ladybugs there too. Pretty ones.

CHRISSA: Wait, what? 

ALLY: I dreamed about the apocalypse… but it was a really fun apocalypse.

(Awkward silence.) 

AUTUMN: I don’t know what you weirdos are talking about...I just remember the giant ladybug.

ALLY:  I can’t fall back asleep, somebody turn the music back on.

Grayson, the laid back one 
Simon, the uptight one

(FERG, BEN, and PRESI finally approach front of line on the apron. SIGN SPINNERS spin. SIMON and GRAYSON are in line, along with TERRENCE and other CUSTOMERS.)

PRESI: That was the strangest one yet. What was that about the giant ladybug?

BEN: I don’t know. Hey look, it’s our turn.

FERG: Finally!

(CURTAINS open on Sandwich Shop.)

SANDWICH GIRL: (monotone) Next! Welcome to Harry’s Build Your Own Sandwich Shop, Where Quality Comes Quick. Can I take your order?

FERG: I’ll have a Number 2 with extra pickles.

SANDWICH GIRL: Coming right up. Next! Welcome to Harry’s Build Your Own Sandwich Shop, Where Quality Comes Quick. Can I take your order?

BEN: I’ll have a turkey and swiss with everything.

SANDWICH GIRL: Everything?

BEN: Everything.

SANDWICH GIRL: Coming right up. Next! Welcome to Harry’s Build Your Own Sandwich Shop, Where Quality Comes Quick. Can I take your order?

PRESI: I’ll have my usual.

SANDWICH GIRL: Excuse me, do I know you? This isn’t a bar. 

PRESI: Oh sorry. Just gimme a ham and cheese on white toast. And a Coke.

SANDWICH GIRL: Coming right up. Next! Welcome to Harry’s Build Your Own Sandwich Shop, Where Quality Comes Quick. Can I take your order?

MICKEY: No.

(MICKEY exits shop. SANDWICH GIRL looks confused, rolls her eyes.)

SANDWICH GIRL: Next!

(CURTAINS close on Sandwich Shop leaving SIMON and GRAYSON in line on the apron, with TERRENCE somewhere close behind them, as well as other CUSTOMERS IN LINE. “Versace on the Floor” plays in the background.)

GRAYSON: Hey, you want a chip?

SIMON: Sure, thanks. Wait--shouldn’t you pay for those first?

GRAYSON: Nah, It’s almost our turn. I’ll just pay when we get up there.

(GRAYSON turns the chip bag upside down and opens it from the bottom.)

SIMON: No! Why would you open a bag like that?! It hurts my soul to see a bag opened upside down. So messed up.

GRAYSON: What are you talking about?

SIMON: You opened the bag from the wrong end!

GRAYSON: What’s the big deal? There’s no wrong way to open a bag of chips. See? (shows open bag to SIMON) Either way, they’re inside the bag just being chips.

SIMON: But there has to be some consistency to life! Up is up and down is down! What if we had no constant?! What would happen then?! We would all go mad and everything would be chaos!

GRAYSON:  But Simon, you have a constant: me. You’re always with me, that’s something, now come on! It’s a good to do something different once in a while! Besides, does the bag make any difference to the chips? Do the chips know that they are upside down? Does the bag know? If they do, then that would make them sentient beings. You’re a vegetarian, don’t you see that as a conflict? It would be a like eating a little bag of death! 

(GRAYSON smiles a wide mocking smile and puts a chip in his mouth, trying not to laugh while chewing.)

SIMON: What are you even saying anymore? You really are one twisted human being, Grayson. 

(GRAYSON grabs another few chips and throws them in his mouth, smiling.)

GRAYSON: Mmmm, so good.

SIMON: If you ever need me to teach you how to eat chips then I can always help, or if you don’t want my help I can always sign you up for a class, or maybe you could see my therapist about this problem?

GRAYSON: I still don’t see the big deal. Aren’t you hungry?

SIMON: As a matter of fact I’m starving. I'm going to be late to my therapy appointment if we have to wait much longer. Yeah, gimme a chip. You’re coming with me, right?

GRAYSON: Of course.

(GRAYSON and SIMON eat chips. Music fades. LIGHTS out.)

JAMES HATCHER, therapist 
COACH SAGGS, life coach extraordinaire

(Set change on apron to Therapist Waiting Room. Cue elevator music. LIGHTS up on waiting room. JEREMY sits waiting. SIMON and GRAYSON enter with their sandwiches, sit beside JEREMY, unwrap them, and take a bite.)

JEREMY: Hey, that looks pretty good.

SIMON: Yeah, it does. I got it right down the street. 

GRAYSON: I think the place is called Harry’s. It took forever, but it is good. 

JEREMY: Can I have a bite?

SIMON: Um, no.

RECEPTIONIST: Jeremy Ha- Ha- Hasler? Sorry for the wait. The doctor is ready for you now.

JEREMY: Finally! 

(CURTAINS open on therapist JAMES HATCHER’S office. Elevator music fades out. JEREMY walks up the stairs into office, shakes hands with JAMES, and sits down.)

JEREMY: Hello Doctor.

JAMES: Please, call me James.

JEREMY: Can I call you Doc?

JAMES: Uh, let's stick with James. I’m just a therapist.

JEREMY: Okay, James.

JAMES: So, tell me about yourself.

JEREMY: Well, my full name is Jeremy Marry-me “Mow the Lawn” Hasler. 

JAMES: (sarcastically) That’s nice. Are you married?

JEREMY: No.

JAMES: Do you have kids?

JEREMY: No.

JAMES: (coughs) Loser. (to JEREMY) So Jeremy, How old are you?

JEREMY: I’m 48.

JAMES: Wow. And uh, what do you do for a living?

JEREMY: Turf Aesthetics Specialist. 

JAMES: Huh?

JEREMY: I mow lawns. I’ve been mowing lawns since I was 12 years old. My dad wanted me to go into the family business, selling used cars, but my passion was mowing lawns. Have you ever seen the dew covered grass glistening in the morning light? The perfect ballpark stripes? Admit it, you can see it. You want it.

JAMES: Actually, I kinda do… 

JEREMY: So that’s what I’ve devoted my life to. And that’s why they call me Jeremy Mow-the-Lawn Hasler.

JAMES: Well, Jeremy your passion for lawn mowing is (coughs) commendable. But do you have any other interests or friends you spend time with? 

JEREMY: Yeah, there’s is Leon Brownwimsakley. He’s a hippie, and is addicted to LaCroix. He drinks a whole case a day. It’s crazy. I can’t even hang out with him anymore because he’s always on the road spending all his money on LaCroix.

JAMES: Um, oookay. Well, clearly you live a (sarcastically) very full life. So, what brings you here today?

JEREMY: I am here because of this guy named Jerrald Ralah. You see, I've been mowing lawns for a very long time now. I’ve worked my way up from the bottom, built a name for myself. I finally get invited to mow this guy's lawn. He’s a multi-billionaire. The richest man I've ever met. I’ve wanted his business for years. A good review from him and I’m set for life. So I mowed his lawn, took me 8 hours but I do it. I did a beautiful job: cross-hatching, perfect stripes. My best work. Then he says, “You did this all wrong!” No one has ever said that to me. He had the nerve to give me a bad review on Yelp. And, after just one lousy report, I have completely been thrown in the dumpster! I’m spiraling out of control, doc! I’ve lost my sense of purpose! 

JAMES: Uh huh, so Jeremy, how do you feel about that?

JEREMY: Horrible Doc!


Five Stars Parody
Somebody once told me that I could make some money 
by mowing random people’s lawns
Well, it sounded kinda dumb but I tried it just for fun
And I realized it was my passion

Well, I didn't stop mowing, and I didnt stop mowing
not gonna stop till I make some money
Found an opportunity to mow a lawn
This guy pretty rich, and I thought I´d make tons
So much to mow I can't go slow
This guy’s lawn is freaking enormous
I gotta put on a good show
So people know that I can mow

Hey now give me five stars, cuz I need some money
Hey now give me five stars, so nobody shuns me
I want to buy a home 
So maybe I don't end up all alone

Finished mowing gotta check on my earnings
To see if my life is about to start turning
Well I opened my laptop and gasped
And I watched as my whole world started to collapse
I feel depressed, like I can never win
He gave me one star and my head started to spin
My worlds on fire, my prayers were ignored
Just because of one star up on the board

Hey now give me five stars, cuz I need some money
Hey now give me five stars, so nobody shuns me
I want to buy a home 
So maybe I don't end up all alone

Somebody once asked are you doing okay man
You haven't mowed any lawns for days
I said nope there is no hope
I could use some professional help
And I am done with my lawn mowing days

Well, I’m done with mowing, and I’m not leaf blowing
Lost all confidence to keep on going
My last sliver of hope is now dead
Buried in the backyard under the shed
No more to do no more to see
So I think I need some therapy
Everybody that I have ever known (known!)
They all say that I have to go

Hey now give me five stars, cuz I need some money
Hey now give me five stars, so nobody shuns me
I want to buy a home
So maybe I don't end up all alone

I want to buy a home
So maybe I don't end up all alone


JEREMY: Just Horrible! You don’t understand, I’ve always cut everyone’s grass the same. No complaints, ever!  And Jerrald’s was no different. 

JAMES:  Maybe he just doesn’t like you. Or, I mean, maybe he just doesn’t like the way you cut grass. What I heard you say is that you used the same techniques you always use. 

JEREMY: Yes I did. His grass was flawless. The shark arc, which is when I shake the lawn mower and shove it up, or, uh, forwards. And the boar shore, which is when I stop the lawn mower and go side to side. It always works.

JAMES: (a bit confused) Uh-huh, I see. 

JEREMY: Here, check out this picture.

(JEREMY pulls out his phone and shows a picture on it to JAMES.)

JAMES: Wow, that is truly amazing! A beautiful mowing job. There is no accounting for one mans warped opinion. Let's just forget about Jerald Ralah. He’s just one man. What you need is a confidence boost. I know the perfect person. He consults with me on special cases. And you definitely qualify as a special case.

JEREMY: Will that cost me extra?

JAMES: Just a measly $500 more.

JEREMY: Okay, that seems fair.

(JAMES leaves the room. COACH SAGGS enters. JEREMY stands and holds out his hand to introduce himself.)

JEREMY: Hi, I’m…

COACH SAGGS: (always yelling) I don’t care who you are! I’m here for one reason and one reason only: to help you get your confidence back! You can call me Coach Saggs and that’s it! Now drop and give me 20!

(JEREMY gets out wallet.)

JEREMY: Okay, I think I have a twenty in here… 

COACH SAGGS: What's this?! I’m talking push-ups, son!

(JEREMY drops and struggles to do push-ups. COACH SAGGS counts his push-ups until JEREMY drops flat on the floor in exhaustion.)

COACH SAGGS: You’re pathetic (spits on floor). On your feet. 

JEREMY: (panting with exhaustion) Little help?

COACH SAGGS: Didn't your mamma ever tell you to eat your protein? What you need is a big ol’ sandwich, double meatball, double ham, double pepperoni!   

(JEREMY hangs his head in embarrassment. COACH SAGGS reaches for his hand and pulls him to his feet.)

COACH SAGGS: Now say, “I’m the best!”

(JEREMY sighs.)	

COACH SAGGS: SAY IT!

JEREMY: (sheepish)  I’m the best?

COACH SAGGS: Louder! 

JEREMY: (slightly louder) I’m the best.

COACH SAGGS: Say it like you mean it!

JEREMY: (louder) I’m the best!

COACH SAGGS: I can’t hear you, son!

JEREMY: (yelling) I’m the best!!!

COACH SAGGS: Who's the best?!

JEREMY: (Yelling louder) I am!

COACH SAGGS: Who’s the best?!!

JEREMY: (Yelling even louder) I am!!

COACH SAGGS: Best at what?!!

JEREMY: (screaming, fully confident now) Mowing the lawn! Mowing the lawn! I’M THE BEST AT MOWING THE LAWN!!!

COACH SAGGS: My work here is done.

(COACH SAGGS exits. JEREMY sits down. JAMES enters and sits at his desk.)

JAMES: Did it work? Do you feel better?

JEREMY: Much. That really helped. Ralah? Who cares about him?! He must be blind because that lawn was beautiful! 

JAMES: Yeah, it was!

JEREMY: Well, that’s a relief.

JAMES: And I see you got your confidence back.

JEREMY: Yeah, that Coach Saggs is a genius.
 
JAMES: Yeah, he’s one of the best. And he charges so little. On a side note, looks like we’re out of time. That will be… (computes on his adding machine) $1,467.32. 

JEREMY: What a bargain! Thanks, Doc.

(They shake hands as CURTAINS CLOSE.)

SCENE 11: WAITING AND IMPATIENT
(JEREMY and COACH SAGGS enter on opposite ends of apron.)

JEREMY: Hey Coach, thanks again for your help.

COACH: You’re welcome. Where are you headed?

JEREMY: I thought I’d get that meatball sandwich you recommended. Not sure I have enough cash now. You want to join me?

COACH: Sure, I’ll buy, but it has to be fast. I have a plane to catch.

JEREMY: No problem. Follow me.

(JEREMY cuts at the front of the line. CUSTOMERS complain. JEREMY ignores them.)

CUSTOMER:  Can you believe this guy!?

Brandy, Annoyed Flight Attendant 
Candy, Bossy Flight Attendant
Pilot
Passengers

(CURTAINS open on PILOT and flight attendants BRANDY and CANDY welcoming passengers as they enter plane. COACH SAGGS boards plane with a sandwich. CROTCHETY OLD MAN steps onto the plane, grumbling about his feet and how cold it is. His only luggage is a small animal crate with a blanket draped over it. Cue plane engine sound in background. COACH SAGGS walks onto the plane with his sandwich.)

PILOT: (to COACH) Welcome aboard Ununited Airlines, sir. Enjoy your flight.  

COACH: Thanks.

PILOT: Welcome aboard, sir.

CANDY: Sorry, sir. We don’t allow outside food on board. But we have a full menu of overpriced snack crackers you can purchase.

(COACH glares at CANDY, shoves entire sandwich in his mouth, walks to his seat.)

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Hello, captain! Where is the assistant I hired?  These old bones could use some help. Is this her?

CANDY: (pushing BRANDY in front) Oh! Yes, of course! This is Brandy. She will help you to your seat. Please let her know if you need anything at all, alright?

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Okey dokey! C’mon Britney. 

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN turns and starts pushing people as he walks down the aisle.)

BRANDY: It’s Brandy.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: What was that, dear?

BRANDY: My name is Brandy, sir.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: You know, I should turn up my hearing aid, if you’re gonna mumble.

BRANDY: It's Brandy.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Ok, ok. Don’t need to get sassy! 

BRANDY: May I see your ticket?  You’re in row 27, follow me.

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN gives his ticket to BRANDY and she leads him to his row. In his row, PREGNANT LADY and JESS, her four-year-old daughter sit.)

PREGNANT MOM: Oh hello, are you sitting here? 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: (pushes past BRANDY) Yes, we are and I would appreciate it if you would move along and get to your own seat!

PREGNANT MOM: I'm really sorry, but this is my son and they have us separated on our tickets. He's only four, so would you mind switching? 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: I don't care how old he is or how pregnant you are! That's my seat and I intend to sit there! 

PREGNANT MOM: But my seat is just right there. (pointing across the aisle)

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Exactly my point! Why don’t you go sit in it?!

PREGNANT MOM: Fine. (to BRANDY) What is wrong with him?

(BRANDY shrugs and sighs.)

PREGNANT MOM: Jess, I want you to be a good boy, ok? And if you need anything mommy will be right over there, alright?

JESS: Ok Mommy.

PREGNANT MOM: See you soon sweetie.

(PREGNANT LADY moves to her assigned seat.)

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: (bows his head) After you, Bridget.

(BRANDY sighs and sits next to Jess.)

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: You won't mind watching my pet will you, Betsy? 

(Without waiting for an answer, he shoves the crate onto her lap and sits down. JESS leans over and lifts a corner of the blanket off of the crate, trying to look inside.)

JESS: What’cha got in there, mister?

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN swats at JESS’ hand.)

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: DON'T TOUCH THAT! It's none of your business! 

PREGNANT MOM: (distressed) Jess, don’t mess with the old man's things.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Lady, you need to teach your kid some manners! When I was a youngster, if I did something like that, my parents would’ve tanned my hide. Kids these days… 

PILOT: Welcome to Ununited Airlines. I'm your pilot, Captain So-and-So. Please direct your attention to the front of the cabin for the safety demonstration.

(CANDY pantomimes the seat belt, life vest, and oxygen mask demonstrations as she barks the orders at the passengers.)
PILOT: Oxygen and the air pressure are always being monitored. In the event of a catastrophic failure that causes total decompression, an oxygen mask will probably appear in front of you. To start the flow of oxygen, pull the mask towards your face. Place it firmly over your nose and mouth, secure the elastic band behind your head, and hyperventilate. Although the bag does not inflate, oxygen is probably flowing to the mask. If you are travelling with a child or someone who requires assistance, ask yourself, Would they do the same for you? And really, if such events occur, you should probably be more worried about the ten thousand foot free-fall.
JESS: Mommy, who’s gonna put on my breathing mask?

PREGNANT MOM: Don't worry, sweetie.

PILOT: We’ll be handing out release forms to ensure that you do not hold us liable for damages including but not limited to spinal compression, sudden height loss, internal bleeding/hemorrhaging, broken bones, lacerations, to inner or outer body, total organ failure, coma, concussion, limb removal, contact with foreign contagion and/or hazardous fluid(s), uncontrollable cell growth in the abdomen, arms, legs and/or head, acid burn, normal burns, sudden decompression, hazardous gas, ejection from the plane at a height up to and above three meters, sudden pregnancy, explosives, childbirth without doctor, or damage to property above the value of $3.50. Flight attendants, please take your seats. We’re clear for take-off! 

CANDY: For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign. This will indicate that it is safe for you to move about the cabin. 

(Sound effects of plane taking off. BORKSWORTH hisses and grunts, safety  briefing continues in background)

BRANDY: (startled) Woah. What kind of a creature is this? 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: That's none of your business, Bertha.

JESS: What's its name? 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: HIS name is Sir Nippit Sandport Borksworth. 

JESS: That’s a funny name.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: You watch your mouth, young man! Sir Nippit has won three blue ribbons in Florida’s Annual Finer Irregular Pet Show. 

(BORKSWORTH continues to hiss and grunt, cage rattles violently. CANDY approaches BRANDY.)

CANDY: Hey Brandy, what is that thing? You need to get him to calm it down. The passengers are getting upset. If you can’t get it to be quiet, I’ll have to stow it below.

BRANDY: Do what you have to do. I don’t know what to do with it.

CANDY: Isn’t that your job? To take care of that crotchety old man and all of his things?

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Hey!

BRANDY: My training didn’t cover babysitting pets and you know it, Candy.

CANDY: Not my problem, Brandy. Just deal with it.

BRANDY: Ok, I’ll deal with it. Here. I delegate this to you, oh queen of the flight attendants.

(BRANDY hands the cage to CANDY.)

CANDY: Wait--no!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: You will NOT take my prize winning alligator! 

BRANDY: Alligator?! 

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN reaches for the crate. He and CANDY struggle over it.) 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: I’ll have you know, Sir Nippit Sandport Borksworth has won THREE blue ribbons and he is going to win again this year! You will NOT take him from me! 

CANDY: Well, I don't know who let you bring this animal onto the plane, but the other passengers are getting nervous.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: I already told you, you can't have him!!

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN gets the crate from FLIGHT ATTENDANT.) 

CANDY: Fine, sir, but keep it quiet or I’ll have to contain him in the cargo bin. 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: (to BORKSWORTH) It’s okay, my little prize fighter. My little warrior. Don’t you listen to that shrew. No one puts Borksworth under the plane. Hey miss, get me some tape and I’ĺl fix this.

(CANDY nods and hurries to the back of the plane. Comes back with a roll of tape, hands it to the man.) 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Great! Now Brittney, open the cage. I’ll restrain him while you tape his mouth shut.

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN hands tape to BRANDY.)

BRANDY: Wait--what!?

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: On three. One, two, three!

(Cage opens, mayhem ensues.) 

PILOT: (over intercom) Ladies and gentlemen, Captain So-and-So here. We are experiencing some turbulence. Please fasten your seat belts. And hold on.

(Cue plane engine sound. Plane and PASSENGERS shake violently. CROTCHETY OLD MAN and BRANDY continue to wrestle with the cage, the tape, and BORKSWORTH. Finally, BORKSWORTH escapes and flies through the air. PASSENGERS gasp, scream, etc.)

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Oh no! Sir Bosworth come back here right now!

PASSENGER  : Oh my god!

PASSENGER  : What was that?

PASSENGER  : It was a lizard!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Borky!

PASSENGER  : It’s got big teeth!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: He’s trained to bite!

PASSENGER  : It just touched my leg!

PASSENGER  : I’m gonna faint!

PREGNANT MOM: I think I’m going into labor!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: My sciatica!

CANDY: Oh my god, stay calm. Is there a doctor on the plane? And why doesn’t Brandy catch that thing?  Where the heck is she anyway?  I’ve never liked her!

PASSENGER  : It’s over here now!

PASSENGER  : Oh my god, it’s crawling up my leg!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: (wailing sadly) NOOOOOO! SIR NIPPIT SANDPORT BORKSWORTH! Come back! Miss, help me get him back!

CANDY: I’m a little busy at the moment!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: (turns to JESS) It’s up to you,Princess sonny! Your tiny body will fit under the seats. Crawl under and find him.  He’ll come to you, he loves kids.

JESS: Cool! Sure thing, mister!

PREGNANT MOM: (yelling) NO! Son, I forbid you!

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: Go find my gator! I don't care how, just find him! 

(JESS crawls around searching.)

JESS: (to passengers) Everybody, hold still! I think I see him!

(PASSENGERS continue to panic… pointing, jumping, huddling in fear, barfing in bag, yelling, etc.)

PILOT: (through speaker, calm voice) Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain. We will be beginning our descent into sunny Orlando, Florida. Flight attendants, please prepare the cabin for landing.

BRANDY: (sarcastically) Very funny.

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: This isn’t funny, Bubbles! Sir Borksworth is loose on a plane with common folk. He could get sick!

BRANDY: What--BUBBLES? It’s Brandy. Not Brittney, not Bertha, not Bethany, and definitely NOT Bubbles! Get it right!

PREGNANT MOM: AAAAHHHHHH!!!

JESS: Mom! Did you see that?! I almost caught an alligator!

PREGNANT MOM: GO SIT DOWN!

JESS: Aw, ma!

(JESS goes to his seat. Plane jostles as it lands.)

PILOT: (over intercom) Attention passengers, we’ve arrived at our final destination, Orlando, Florida--wait a minute, this doesn’t look like Orlando… Hmmm… In any case, please remain seated until the plane has come to a full stop. We know you have a choice when you fly, and so on behalf of all of us here at Ununited Airlines, we thank you and hope you’ll choose us again. Welcome to wherever we are!

(PASSENGERS begin to exit the plane, watching the ground very carefully as they do. CANDY and PILOT bid them goodbye as they exit.) 

CANDY: Captain, I think you just made a big circle. Doesn’t this look like the gate we took off from?

PILOT: Interesting… I suppose it does. Keen observation, Candy.

BRANDY: Captain, we have a situation back here!

PILOT: (laughs loudly) Oh Brandy, I'm sure you’re exaggerating. Now go clean seats, you have another senior to help on the next flight. 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN: (overjoyed) I FOUND HIM! I FOUND HIM! SIR NIPPIT SANDPORT BORKSWORTH, YOU NAUGHTY BOY! WE’RE GOING HOME!

(CROTCHETY OLD MAN opens the crate and puts SIR BORKSWORTH inside, then shuts and locks the door. He proudly walks down the aisle with his prize-winning pet.) 

CROTCHETY OLD MAN (to BRANDY): Hey Bertha, do you know where I can grab me a sandwich around here? Borkworth’s a bit peckish. (to BORKSWORTH) Oh, my hungry little baby, Daddy’s gonna get you a nice juicy tuna sandwich.

(LIGHTS out. CURTAINS close.)

SCENE 13: WAITING AND IRATE

(CURTAINS open on Harry’s Build-Your-Own Sandwich Shop and a line of customers.)

SANDWICH GIRL: Next! Welcome to Harry’s Build Your Own Sandwich Shop, Where Quality Comes Quick. Can I take your order?

TERRENCE: Of course! Um… What type of bread do you have?

SANDWICH GIRL: (points to menu) As the menu states, we’ve got sourdough, rye, white, whole wheat, pita and bagels. 

TERRENCE: Oh! So many options, how will I ever choose?

SANDWICH GIRL: They’re all good, sir. They’re all bread. So, what’ll it be? We’ve got a long line of customers to serve and I have sandwiches to make.

(Impatient sighs and frustrated grumbles are heard among the LINE OF CUSTOMERS.)

TERRENCE: Very well, I will have the--OH! You have PICKLES? Sweet pickles, dill pickles, AND kosher? (whimpering) How will I ever decide?

SANDWICH GIRL: SIR!

TERRENCE: Please stop calling me that! My name is TERRENCE! T-E-R-R-R--oh I always say an extra R. Heh, my mom used to tease me about that.

SANDWICH GIRL: Sir--Terrence, just pick your bread...

TERRENCE: Alright, Alright, pickles! I mean bread! I mean Rye, Rye bread. (giggles) I guess I still had pickles on my mind! I get confused when I hurry.

OTIS: What is taking so long? I’m hungry! AND late!

TERRENCE: (turns to look at OTIS) How VERY rude. What is your name?

OTIS: (annoyed) My name? My name? I don’t see how that matters right now. Just make your sandwich!

TERRENCE: WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

OTIS: OTIS! Now hurry up and order your sandwich.

TERRENCE: (puts a hand on Otis’ shoulder) Otis my friend, all I want is a sandwich. A ME sandwich. A sandwich only I could come up with. A very special sandwich. At Harry’s, I get to build my very own sandwich. A ME sandwich. A me-wich. Ha! See what I did there?

Otis: I’m not your friend

SANDWICH GIRL: Yes, we ALL see everything you're doing.

OTIS: (yelling) AND ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO HURRY UP! MY LUNCH BREAK IS ALMOST OVER AND I’M HUNGRIER than a bag of alligators.

SANDWICH GIRL: SIR! 

TERRENCE: Please, call me Terrence. T-E-

SANDWICH GIRL: Ugh, fine. Terrence, stop arguing with my customers and finish your sandwich. 

TERRENCE: Uhhh… I want bread.

SANDWICH GIRL: I know, rye. How about some cheese?

TERRENCE: Oooh, you have cheese?! Oh goody! Let’s see… Cheese…  Lots of cheese… Swiss? Pepper Jack? Provolone? Gouda? 

MR. GRAY: Hey, what’s the hold-up up there?

OTIS: This man can’t decide on a sandwich. He is stuck at cheese.

TERRENCE: (whimpers) Asiago, Havarti, Colby. Wait what’s the one with the mold? I probably shouldn’t eat mold.  I might be allergic.

OTIS: Can you believe this guy?

MR. GRAY: Look buddy, I really need to get somewhere, so hurry it up. 

TERRENCE: (getting up) Don't rush me. I don’t make good decisions when I’m rushed. Cheeses, hmm, gouda, blue, cheddar...

(Everyone glares.)

MR. GRAY: (yelling) Did you hear me? I’m late!

TERRENCE: Late for what?  

MR. GRAY: Hospital.

TERRENCE, SANDWICH GIRL, AND OTIS: The hospital?!

TERRENCE: Why do you need to be at the hospital?

MRS. GRAY: (moans in pain) Ohhhh!!! Oooh, this one really hurts! Hurry up, honey! My contractions are getting closer.

MR. GRAY: You see, my wife here is about to have our first baby and I would really like a sandwich before the big event. Hospital food is notoriously terrible and anyway I’ll need my strength to get through it.

SANDWICH GIRL: Are you kidding me?!

OTIS: What are you waiting for? Go now!

MR. GRAY: I’m waiting for a sandwich! I’m hungry!

SANDWICH GIRL: (yelling) Would someone PLEASE get this poor woman and her idiotic husband to the hospital?

MR. GRAY: Hey, I'm standing RIGHT HERE! And, I really do need that sandwich!

TERRENCE: (whining) What about my sandwich?

SANDWICH GIRL: (snaps) Your sandwich can wait!

TERRENCE: (whining) But I was just about to pick my cheese…

SANDWICH GIRL: No, you weren’t! You were deciding if you even wanted cheese. YOU’LL NEVER MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

MRS. GRAY: AAAHHHH!!!!

EVERYONE: JUST PICK SOMETHING!!!

Pick Something Parody
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
I’ll fix the food, if you want me to
Anything on bread will do,
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
 
And I am feeling so bored
You are taking so long
That guy’s starting to snore 
And I am about to pass out
My blood sugar’s so low
I would eat sauerkraut
 
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that nothing is right for you
I’m gonna pick up and leave this zoo
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
 
And I just might eat my hat
I’ve been waiting so long
Just think about that
And I am done with this guy!
He just can’t decide
I think I might die!
 
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
I hate that you are such a fickle dude,
And anything on bread will do
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
 
Pick something, I'm giving up on you
Pick something

MRS. GRAY: (breathing heavily, Lamaze style, turns to MR. GRAY)  AAAAHHHHHH!!!! Hurry, honey! This baby’s getting impatient!

SANDWICH GIRL: YES! HURRY!

MRS. GRAY: (to MR. GRAY) You said you would be fast!

TERRENCE and MR. GRAY: I want my sandwich!

SANDWICH GIRL AND OTIS: You can wait!

(CUSTOMERS groan and complain. MANAGER enters.)

MANAGER: (yelling) What is going on in here?!

(EVERYONE stops and looks.) 

MANAGER: I am the manager of Harry’s Build-Your-Own Sandwich Shop. Where quality comes quick! I have been getting complaints of a customer taking too long and what I want to know is--OH! (suddenly distracted) We have pickles!? 

(MANAGER grabs a pickle and exits.)

TERRENCE: Provolone, yeah, Provolone. Wait… what about, no. Maybe! 

(Everyone glares.)

SANDWICH GIRL: Otis, take Mr. and Mrs. Gray to their car and make sure they go to the hospital. Terrence, move out of the way so that someone else can order. 

TERRENCE: What?! But I’ve been waiting!

OTIS: Who put you in charge?

SANDWICH GIRL: Me. I work here and nobody else has any common sense so I’m taking charge.

TERRENCE: I’ve decided. Provolone. Definitely Provolone. You know, that’s a funny word, Provolone.

OTIS: I’m not taking orders from you!

SANDWICH GIRL: (yells) You’re all acting like 5 year olds.

MR. GRAY AND OTIS AND TERRENCE: RUDE! 

TERRENCE: (singing) Provolone! Provolone Provolone… 

MRS. GRAY: Someone, please hurry! THIS BABY IS NOT GOING to WAIT MUCH LONGER!

BRATTY CUSTOMER: So dramatic.

MRS. GRAY: Oh yeah, Well, I’m gonna have this baby right here on this Sandwich Shop floor!

BRATTY CUSTOMER: I will like die if she does that.

SANDWICH GIRL: OTIS!

TERRENCE: (getting louder each time) PROVOLONE! PROVOLONE! PROVOLONE!!!

EVERYONE: WE HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME!

TERRENCE: I just want my sandwich!

OTIS: Me too!

EVERYONE IN LINE: We do too!

SANDWICH GIRL: Newsflash: Your sandwiches are not the number one priority right now! (points at MRS. GRAY) This woman is about to have a baby on my floor and you’re worried about your sandwiches?!

TERRENCE: Please just put the cheddar on my sandwich.

OTIS: Cheddar?  

MR. GRAY: (points at SANDWICH GIRL) This is horrible service! I’m going to give you a bad rating on Yelp if this doesn’t speed up.

SANDWICH GIRL: Ratings? I don’t care about ratings right now. I just need your wife to not have a baby on the floor of Harry’s Sandwich Shop. I’m the one who has to mop at close.

MR. GRAY: Are you kicking me out?

SANDWICH GIRL: No! I mean yes! I mean--AAAARRGHH! Just please get your wife to the hospital! 

MR. GRAY: FINE! I was leaving anyway. Jeeze. 

(MR. and MRS. GRAY exit.)

SANDWICH GIRL: Good!

TERRENCE: Can I have my sandwich now?

SANDWICH GIRL: (sighs) FINE. Rye with provolone. What veggies?

TERRENCE: Probably lettuce.

SANDWICH GIRL: Probably? What do you mean by probably?

TERRENCE: I was thinking, what if the lettuce gets crushed in the sandwich? What if the lettuce gets ruined like that?

SANDWICH GIRL: The lettuce doesn’t care!

TERRENCE: (sad) But I do.

OTIS: Will you please Hurry up!

TERRENCE: Yes, Sandwich Girl, I have waited long enough! HURRY UP! I think I do want the lettuce after all!

SANDWICH GIRL: (in a menacing tone) Fine! Lettuce! (slaps down the lettuce) Anything else?

TERRENCE: Hmmmm. Since you asked, sure, and Onions, tomatoes, aaaand pickles.

SANDWICH GIRL: Wow.

TERRENCE: (pauses) Whaaat?

SANDWICH GIRL: You… actually decided on something.

OTIS: (sarcastically) Yaaaay. Now hurry up. We all have places to go and things to do. Chop chop.

TERRENCE: Oops. Did I say tomatoes? I just remembered they’re not in season right now and you know how they get mushy? I hate that. How about ketchup instead. Errr, wait no! Mustard. Lots of pickles. No onions. Is it possible for me to taste them all? No… too complicated. How about all of the things I said? NO! NONE! Can I just start over?

SANDWICH GIRL: (stares open-mouthed) What?! I’m just going to make you a BLT. 

TERRENCE:  BACON?! YOU HAVE MEAT!? Wow! Mind blown! You know, I’ve been a vegetarian all my life, but now might be a great time to try meat. But wait! I can’t have bad meat for my first taste! I need the best, most scrumptious most succulent meat there ever was! (starts jumping up and down very excited)

(SANDWICH GIRL throws the BLT at TERRENCE.)

SANDWICH GIRL: You’ll love bacon. Here, BLT, $5.50!

(TERRENCE throws the BLT on the floor.)

TERRENCE: That’s not what I asked for!

SANDWICH GIRL: What did you ask for then?

TERRENCE: The first thing.

SANDWICH GIRL: Onions, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Pickles, and Provolone on Rye?

TERRENCE: No, um, just provolone on rye… AND PICKLES!
I’ve decided.

SANDWICH GIRL: Provolone and Pickles on Rye.

TERRENCE: YES!

EVERYBODY: FINALLY!

(SANDWICH GIRL hands TERRENCE his sandwich.) 

SANDWICH GIRL: That’ll be $8.50.

(TERRENCE pays then proudly raises his sandwich in the air.)
 
TERRENCE: I call it… the PPR! Provolone and Pickles on Rye! (he takes a bite then spits it out) YUCK! 

(MR. and MRS. GRAY enter with BABY raised up in air.)

MRS. GRAY: It’s a boy!  

MR. GRAY: And I need that sandwich!

SANDWICH GIRL: What’d you name him?

MRS. GRAY: We haven’t decided yet.

TERRENCE: Oohh! Oohh! Let me pick! I’m really good at picking names! Pickles, hmmm that’s not a name. Jerry? Todd? Randy? Joe? Samuel? Sean? Gaaahhh no, no. Maybe it should start with and L or an O or a-Wait! No. Hmmmm let me think. (curtains close).


Scene 15: The Bitter End
(JIM, BETH, and GUS are customers in line.)

JIM: Are we ever going to get our food?

BETH: Probably not. 

JIM: Should we just leave.

BETH: There is no use leaving now. Besides the line seems to be moving again. We should just wait it out.

JIM: Look at all these hungry people. This place is really popular so it must be good.

BETH: Yeah, their sandwiches are good but I have never seen it so busy.

GUS: Sandwiches?! Is that what we are waiting in line for? Sandwiches. Cool!

BETH: Why are you even in this line if you don't know what you're waiting for?

GUS: I just like lines.

BETH: What?

GUS: If people are willing to wait in line for something usually it's pretty good. The waiting is the hardest part.


The Waiting Parody
By Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers

Oh baby, don’t it feel like heaven right now?
Don’t it feel like something from a dream?
Well, I’ve never known a wait quite like this
Don’t it feel like we might never ever eat again
Baby, you don’t even have to try and pretend
This sandwich will taste better after waiting like this

I said Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

The waiting was the hardest part
We’re almost there, we’ve come so far 
These last five minutes have been so hard 
The waiting was the hardest part

Well yeah I might’ve dined all around this town
All it ever got me was down 
Yeah then there were wraps, and stale tacos
But nothing as great as this sandwich right now
The waiting seems to make it taste better somehow
I’ve never felt alive like I feel alive now 

I said, Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

The waiting is the hardest part
I never thought we’d move up at all 
But the line is moving, we’re almost to the start
The waiting was the hardest part

You know you’ll get your turn, don’t let it get to you
It’s almost your turn, don’t let it get to you
It’s not worth your breakin heart, don’t be a cryin fool
Don’t let it get you down
Don’t let it get to you

(Kazoo Shredding)

Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

The waiting was the hardest part
Lunch is almost over but you all know 
These sandwiches are best by far  
The waiting is the hardest part
The waiting is the hardest part 


THE END
