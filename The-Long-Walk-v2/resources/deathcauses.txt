the colors of the world fly from you.
your vision drains from your perceptual grasp, gone to flit about the stars.
bones snap into otherworldly positions as your mortal frame fails to adapt.
the grand machine of life loses the spark it clung so desperately to.
such terrible things, over in seconds after the powerful claws began their work.
