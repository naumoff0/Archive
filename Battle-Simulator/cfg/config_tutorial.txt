/* 
	Directions on how to add a player:
	
	There are 5 values you need to separate by spaces.
	The values are these in order
	
*	Name
*	Class Type
*	Strength
*	Endurance
*	Id  

In order to initialize a player, you must add one to the last line of the config file.
Let's say you wanted to add a player named Joe

Joe would have a 
Name of Joe
Class Type of Knight 
Strength of 4
Endurance of 3 
and an Id of 6 

Joe would be declared like this:

Joe Knight 4 3 6

Notice how these are all separated by spaces.

RULES FOR DECLARING PLAYERS:

Names can not have spaces although they can have these things in between:
_
-
.
etc.

Example of acceptable names: 

Joe-The-Example
Joe_is-a_player

Examples of unacceptable names:

Joe the Example
Joe-is-a player

NOTE: The same thing goes for class names to.

WARNING: Do not forget to add spaces in between. Seriously.

To determine Id, simply count how many players there are and add one to that number.

To make your player fight, start the program and input your player's id when it asks.

HOW TO ADD AN ENEMY BELOW:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	Directions on how to add an enemy
	
	Adding an enemy is close to the same thing as adding a player except with different values
	
*	Enemy Values Are:
*	Name 
*	HP //Health Points
*	AC //Armour Class 
*	DT //Dice Type 
*	Id 
	
	For example enemys look down below.
	
	Same rules for names as there was for players.
	
	Make sure that the Dice Type is not less than 2 or greater than 20.
	
	WARNING: Include 0 before AC as it won't read it as a decimal if you don't
	
	Eg: 0.5 = 50% etc.
